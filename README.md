# Python

### Introduction course to the Python language given by the Meninas Programadoras together with USP (University of SÃ£o Paulo). It was carried out completely remotely and addressed basic concepts and main rules.

### Here's some code I put together to solve some problems that were passed as activities.

### The codes were made by Replit, here is the link: <a href=https://replit.com/@thaismotta2004>Replit</a>
